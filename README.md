# Python 101 Assessment

Scenario - 

You have to create a program for an online shop deal where if a customer buys five items they get the fifth free. The program should take in the five products and their cost and then display them by price (highest to lowest). It should then calculate a total cost discounting the cheapest item and display the total owed.

This is from my Computer Programming class that I did at the end of 2019. I hadn't touched Python, (or any language..) for a **long time**. However I actually found the bulk of this to be more of a refresher, rather than learning.

The hardest part for me, doing this assessment, was the sorting. I was incredibly dumb, and when sorting the prices from highest to smallest, the item names were not being sorted. So if I had - 

* Xbox One £400
* Socks £2
* Shoes £40

It would sort to look like - 

* Xbox One £400
* Socks £40
* Shoes £2

The obvious solution that I didn't see was to, when the bubble sort changes the position of a price, to also just change the position of the item in the range. *I'm so dumb.*

Anyways, I never claimed to be a developer, and that's probably why. I don't think about code correctly, and as a result, I spend days figuring out how to add.. a line of code?

Cool. We've established I'm not great. Enjoy looking at this terrible 1st year uni student code.
